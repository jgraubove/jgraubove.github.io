# My Vision

**TL:DR** I am intrested in a heritage science that scales up well to the magnitude of the challenge. This requires engineering solutions for improved data collection, predictive capacity and decision making.

_Confucius said: “Zigong, do you take me for someone who learns a lot and then stores it all up in my head?” Zigong replied: “Yes, is that not the case?” Confucius said: “No. I weave it all together into a single thread.”_

I decided to create this site in summer 2022, when in a short period of time, my team published articles on the following topics:

- 🏰 historic glass windows
- 📚 archives and reading rooms
- 👪 natural language processing
- 🔩 corrosion of metals

First I was proud, but then pride gave way to uneasiness. I feared that, to the casual observer, these topics would look arbitrary. I know they are not. True, our work is imaginative and diverse, but not random. There is a single thread that weaves it all together. In this page I will explain why. 

## 1. The science of things

We humans exist in a brief slice of geological time, the Anthropocene. For the last fifteen thousand years, we have been filling our ecosystem with material—most of it rubbish. But within this vast accumulation, a tiny fraction holds value, either for us or for the future. Heritage science is the discipline that studies this small proportion of valuable human artifacts. It is the science of the Anthropocene of Value.

To complicate matters, things are rarely just things. In fact, the most valuable objects often transcend their material form, becoming more than mere things. The most precious parts of the Anthropocene are those that serve as physical manifestations of human culture. Consequently, there is little point in studying these objects solely as materials. They are either integral to living culture or the fossilized remains of past culture.

In short, the task of heritage scientists is challenging because (1) the number of objects in the Anthropocene of Value is vast, and (2) there is no clear boundary between what belongs to this Anthropocene of Value and what does not.

## 2. Panta Rei

Things change. If they didn't, managing them would be much easier. To manage heritage, to take decisions about it, we need to know how it changes. In my years studying this problem, I have learned a few things about change:

- Things change less than you expect, until they don't
- Things change at very different rates, from years to centuries
- The rates of change are a bit inconvenient: extremely fast in geological terms, extremely slow in human terms, they are sort of in-between the interests of other sciences. Heritage has its own clock. 

Knowing the dynamics of change is one of the main tasks of heritage science. Even though great progress has been made, we have barely scratched the surface. Materials science gives us a good, first-principles undersanding of how things may degrade. But the reality is that, for all our knowledge on potential decay mechanisms, we are still unable to predict how our actions will influence the lifetime of most of our valuable things. And to manage them, that's all that matters.


## 3. Engineering for heritage

To recap. Heritage is vast, extending far beyond what we keep in the walls of museums. Its limits are fuzzy, almost undefinable, bound to the complexity of human culture. It changes at varying rates, largely unknown. The challenges for heritage science are, therfore, enormous. 

My objective is to develop heritage science to a point where it can face these challenges. As an engineer, I see this fundamentally as a scalability problem. That is, I believe our current methods to study and manage heritage do not scale well to the real global magnitude of the task. As a result I am drawn to:

1. Increasing the rate of data collection on the dynamics of change and on how humans value it
2. Proposing models of change, caused by environmental factors, and investigating their implementation in managing systems
3. Developing technical solutions that expand the toolbox of heritage management and conservation

## 4. Conclusion

Going back to the intellectual provocation at the start of this page: what's up with these four papers?

- 🏰 historic glass windows - this one focuses on new technology to map degradation data
- 📚 archives and reading rooms - this one integrates a damage function in a management system
- 👪 natural language processing - this one accelerates the rate of data collection on perceptions of change
- 🔩 corrosion of metals - this one develops a solution to support decision making
