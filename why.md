# My Vision

**TL:DR** I am intrested in a heritage science that scales up well to the magnitude of the challenge. This requires engineering solutions for improved data collection, predictive capacity and decision making.

_Confucius said: “Zigong, do you take me for someone who learns a lot and then stores it all up in my head?” Zigong replied: “Yes, is that not the case?” Confucius said: “No. I weave it all together into a single thread.”_

In summer 2022, in a short period of time, my team published articles on the following topics:

- 🏰 historic glass windows
- 📚 archives and reading rooms
- 👪 natural language processing
- 🔩 corrosion of metals

First I was proud, but then pride gave way to uneasiness. I feared that, to the casual observer, these topics would look arbitrary. I know they are not. True, our work is imaginative and diverse, but not random. There is a single thread that weaves it all together. In this page I will explain why. 

## 1. The science of things

We humans live in a tiny slice of geological time, the Anthropocene. For the last fifteen thousand years we have been filling our ecosystem with stuff. Most of it is rubbish. But there is a very small proportion of this gigantic pile of things that has some value, to us or to the future. Heritage science is the science that studies this tiny proportion of valuable human products. It is the science of the **Anthropocene of Value**. 

To make matters more complicated, things are rarely just things. In fact, the most valuable things are so much more, that they are barely things at all. The most valuable bits of the anthropocene are those that are physical manifestations of human culture. As a consequence, there is no point in studying things only as materials. Things are either part of living culture, or fossils remains of past culture.

In sum, the job of heritage scientists is difficult because (1) the number of things in the anthropocene of value is extremely large and (2) there is no clear division between what's part of the antrhopocene of value and what is not. 

## 2. Panta Rei

Things change. If they didn't, managing them would be much easier. To manage heritage, to take decisions about it, we need to know how it changes. In my years studying this problem, I have learned a few things about change:

- Things change less than you expect, until they don't
- Things change at very different rates, from years to centuries
- The rates of change are a bit inconvenient: extremely fast in geological terms, extremely slow in human terms, they are sort of in-between the interests of other sciences. Heritage has its own clock. 

Knowing the dynamics of change is one of the main tasks of heritage science. Even though great progress has been made, we have barely scratched the surface. Materials science gives us a good, first-principles undersanding of how things may degrade. But the reality is that, for all our knowledge on potential decay mechanisms, we are still unable to predict how our actions will influence the lifetime of most of our valuable things. And to manage them, that's all that matters.


## 3. Engineering for heritage

To recap. Heritage is vast, extending far beyond what we keep in the walls of museums. Its limits are fuzzy, almost undefinable, bound to the complexity of human culture. It changes at varying rates, largely unknown. The challenges for heritage science are, therfore, enormous. 

My objective is to develop heritage science to a point where it can face these challenges. As an engineer, I see this fundamentally as a scalability problem. That is, I believe our current methods to study and manage heritage do not scale well to the real global magnitude of the task. As a result I am drawn to:

1. Increasing the rate of data collection on the dynamics of change and on how humans value it
2. Proposing models of change, caused by environmental factors, and investigating their implementation in managing systems
3. Developing technical solutions that expand the toolbox of heritage management and conservation

## 4. Conclusion

Going back to the intellectual provocation at the start of this page: what's up with these four papers?

- 🏰 historic glass windows - this one focuses on new technology to map degradation data
- 📚 archives and reading rooms - this one integrates a damage function in a management system
- 👪 natural language processing - this one accelerates the rate of data collection on perceptions of change
- 🔩 corrosion of metals - this one develops a solution to support decision making
