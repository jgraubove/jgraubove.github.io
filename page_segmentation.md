**Featured heritage:** The impressive Bothwell Castle, managed by Historic Environment Scotland.

**What we learned:** It is possible to get information on degradation from pictures submitted by visitors, even if these pictures are taken from different angles. To achieve this, we combined photogrammetry with semantic segmentation, which is a technique that automatically interprets "segments" of the image. In this case we are literally training a computer to watch grass grow, but it could be used for any material pathology at any time scale.
