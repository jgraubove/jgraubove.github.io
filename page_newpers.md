**What we learned:** The amount of particulate matter in the air is not the best indicator of risk of soiling. We also need to understand how fast this particles get to surfaces, which depends on air velocity, surface inclination and roughness. Therefore, it is best to measure the amount of particles on surfaces when assessing this pollutant in a heritage context.
