**Featured heritage:** It is a model that can be used to interpret online reviews of heritage sites.

**What we learned:** Natural Language Processing is a fascinating field. Here we expand the toolbox by proposing a combination of models that will help researchers explore textual data. The model we propose takes queries from the researcher, for example: "Is this text about historic castles?", and uses them to classify large collections of text. It is the first step towards the massive use of social media information to explore engagement with heritage.
