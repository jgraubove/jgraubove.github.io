**Lead Author:** Cristina Duran

**Featured heritage:** Amsterdam City Archives

**What we learned:** We use the collections demography model developed by Matija Strlic to compare different preservation scenarios. We compare deacidification with improvement of storage conditions. We also test the impact of delaying decisions and investment. I am proud of this paper because it shows an operational use of damage functions to aid practical decision making.
