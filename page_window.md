**Lead Author:** A true collaboration, where Danae Pocobelli brings the modelling, Antanas Melinis the glass chemistry, and Nick Crabb the visualisation.

**Featured heritage:** The "Most Studied House in the World": Hellens Manor in Herefordshire.

**What we learned:** You can use Building Information Modelling software to map and visualise data of interest to conservation. However, it is hard work because the software has not been developed to help heritage science. Unless you have the data science skills, you might be better off with common solutions such as GIS.
