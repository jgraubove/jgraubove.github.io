**Lead Author:** Emily Long

**Featured heritage:** The Oddy Tests performed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and some tests from English Heritage.

**What we learned:** It is possible to train a computer to classify Oddy test coupons using images. However, you need very good images, obtained with a consistent protocol. You also need a very good training set, which means that we first need to agree in which coupons have passed or failed the test! This paper is written in a very accessible language (as far as machine learning papers go), so it can be used as a way to become familiar with the field.
