**Lead Author:** Emilio Cano and many others

**What we learned:** Many museums use the Oddy test to evaluate the corrosivity of emissions from materials. But the test is difficult to reproduce. Some diferences in results are due to the diferences in the coupons preparation. Very often the evaluation criteria play a relevant role in the discrepancies of the results, especially for institutions with less experience in the test
